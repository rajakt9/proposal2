# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO--- Stock Market Information Portal 



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO--- A program that lets you observe the trends of the main stocks and ETF's on the market and gives you recomendations of what to purchase and what not based on there preformance. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO---The sofware will take in stock infomation like shares, open, close etc. It will then use this info to make assesment of the stocks giving prefomance updates and increeses and dips in price across a time period. It will also be able to give recomendations on what the user could potentialy purchase based on the maathatical evaluations of each of the stocks and what might be the best value for money.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable---No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable---No

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO I will want to make sure that program can calculate the ups and downs of stocks and be able to provide the trends to the user. I will also want to be able to provide the user out a set of given stocks a few that the user should consider purchasing.  


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO I think that I will be able to do all the things I listed above plus I also want to be able to make my program be able to provide the percentage of chnage in the stocks. I also want to be able to provide stocks that the user might be interested in depnding on how well they are currently preforming.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO I will need to look into the logic that will be required to work with the large amounts of stock data. This will also requre me to implement some mathematical logic inside my program for it to be able to provide the calculations of the stock trends.
